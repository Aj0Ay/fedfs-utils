.TH NSDB-LIST 8 "15 May 2011"
.SH NAME
nsdb-list \- list file set name and location entries on an NSDB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nsdb-list
.RB [ \-?d ]
.RB [ \-e
.IR nce ]
.RB [ \-l
.IR nsdbname ]
.RB [ \-r
.IR nsdbport ]
.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The bulk of FedFS junction information in a FedFS domain is stored
on one or more LDAP servers.
These servers are known as
.IR "namespace databases" ,
or NSDBs, for short.
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers and clients access the information stored
on NSDBs via standard LDAP queries.
FedFS-enabled file servers use these queries to resolve FedFS junctions.
FedFS administrators use them to manage information
about file sets contained in a FedFS domain name space.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs that are
intended for testing the NSDB protocol or for use in scripts.
It retrieves a list of file set name and location
entries stored on an NSDB.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Specifies that debugging messages be produced during operation.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Prints an
.BR nsdb-list (8)
version and usage message on
.IR stderr ,
then exits.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-nsdbname=\fINSDB-hostname\fP"
Specifies the hostname of the NSDB to enumerate.
If the
.B -l
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_HOST environment variable is consulted.
If the variable is not set and the
.B -l
option is not specified, the
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-nsdbport=\fINSDB-port\fP"
Specifies the IP port of the NSDB to enumerate.
If the
.B -r
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_PORT environment variable is consulted.
The default value if the variable is not set is 389.
.IP "\fB\-e, \-\-nce=\fINSDB-container-entry\fP"
Limits the query to a particular NSDB container entry on the target NSDB.
If the
.B -e
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_NCE environment variable is consulted.
If the variable is not set and the
.B -e
option is not specified,
or the specified NCE does not exist on the target NSDB, the
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command fails.
.SH EXIT CODES
The NSDB returns a value that reflects the success of the requested operation.
.TP
.B FEDFS_OK
The LDAP query succeeded.
A list of FSN and FSL records are summarized on
.IR stdout .
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_ACCESS
The anonymous entity does not have permission to perform the requested operation.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_INVAL
One of the arguments was not valid.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_SVRFAULT
An unanticipated non-protocol error occurred.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_ROUTE
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command was unable to find a route to the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_DOWN
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command determined that the specified NSDB was down.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_CONN
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command was unable to establish a connection with the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_AUTH
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command was unable to authenticate
and establish a secure connection with the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP
A non-specific LDAP error occurred on the connection between the
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command and specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_VAL
An LDAP error occurred on the connection between the
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command and specified NSDB.
The specific error may be displayed on the command line.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_NONCE
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command was unable to locate the NCE on the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_RESPONSE
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command received a malformed response from the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_FAULT
An unanticipated error related to the specified NSDB occurred.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_PARAMS
The local NSDB connection parameter database
does not have any connection parameters on record for the specified NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_REFERRAL
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command received an LDAP referral that it was unable to follow.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_REFERRAL_VAL
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command received an LDAP referral that it was unable to follow.
A specific error may be displayed on the command line.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_REFERRAL_NOTFOLLOWED
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command received an LDAP referral that it chose not to follow,
either because the local implementation does not support
following LDAP referrals or LDAP referral following is disabled.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_PARAMS_LDAP_REFERRAL
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command received an LDAP referral that it chose not to follow
because the local NSDB connection parameter database had no
connection parameters for the NSDB targeted by the LDAP referral.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that you want to know if the LDAP server
.IR ldap.example.net
is an NSDB.  Use:
.RS
.sp
$ nsdb-list -l ldap.example.net -e o=fedfs
.br
NSDB: ldap.example.net:389, o=fedfs
.br
  FSN UUID: dc25a644-06e4-11e0-ae55-000c29dc7f8a
.br
    FSL UUID: f4e88676-06f6-11e0-96ca-000c29dc7f8a
.br
    FSL UUID: 4d2da352-06f2-11e0-a4c7-000c29dc7f8a
.sp
.RE
There is a single file set name, with two file set location records,
registered on this NSDB.
To resolve the listed FSN UUID, use the
.BR nsdb-resolve-junction (8)
command.
.SH SECURITY
The NSDB protocol draft standard requires that FedFS FSN and FSL
records are readable by everyone.
The
.BR nsdb-list (8)
command uses anonymous binding to perform LDAP queries.
.P
The target LDAP server must be registered in the local NSDB connection
parameter database.
The connection security mode listed
in the NSDB connection parameter database
for the target LDAP server is used during this operation.
See
.BR nsdbparams (8)
for details on how to register an NSDB
in the local NSDB connection parameter database.
