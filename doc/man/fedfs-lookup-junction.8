.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [ \-?d ]
.RB [ \-n
.IR nettype ]
.RB [ \-h
.IR hostname ]
.BI "-p " path
.BI "-t " type
.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers allow remote administrative access via an
authenticated RPC protocol known as the
.IR "FedFS ADMIN protocol" .
Using this protocol, FedFS administrators manage
FedFS junctions and NSDB connection parameter information
on remote FedFS-enabled file servers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fedfs-lookup-junction (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs that are
intended for testing the FedFS ADMIN protocol or for use in scripts.
It sends a single FEDFS_LOOKUP_JUNCTION request to a remote
FedFS ADMIN protocol service.
.P
This request causes a remote server to report FedFS junction resolution
results as the remote server sees them.
It can report cached results or can force a fresh junction resolution if,
for example, the contents of an NSDB are known to have changed.
These capabilities are especially useful for tracking down
configuration problems in a FedFS domain.
.P
The contents of a FedFS junction are a UUID and an NSDB name and port.
The meaning of these is described in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
Resolving a junction means performing an NSDB query with the contents
of the junction to obtain the list of fileset locations matching the FSN UUID.
.P
There are three distinct types of junction resolution:
.TP
.B none
The remote server reports the actual contents of the junction stored
on its local disk.
This includes an FSN UUID and the name and port of an NSDB.
.TP
.B cache
The remote server reports resolution results it may have cached from
previous NSDB resolution requests.
This includes an FSN UUID, the name and port of an NSDB, and the cached
list of fileset locations matching the FSN UUID.
Not all FedFS ADMIN service implementations support this type of request.
.TP
.B nsdb
The remote server performs a fresh junction resolution,
and the results are returned.
This includes an FSN UUID, the name and port of an NSDB,
and a list of fileset locations matching the FSN UUID.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Specifies that debugging messages be produced during operation.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Prints a
.BR fedfs-lookup-junction (8)
version and usage message on
.IR stderr ,
then exits.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-hostname=\fIhostname\fP"
Specifies the hostname of a remote FedFS ADMIN service.
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR localhost .
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-nettype=\fInettype\fP"
Specifies the transport to use when contacting the remote FedFS ADMIN service.
Typically the
.I nettype
is one of
.B tcp
or
.BR udp .
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR netpath .
See
.BR rpc (3t)
for details.
.IP "\fB\-p, \-\-path=\fIpathname\fP"
Specifies the location on the remote server where the target FedFS junction
resides.
This pathname is relative to the remote server's physical root directory,
not the remote server's NFS pseudoroot.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-resolvetype=\fItype\fP"
Specifies the desired type of resolution.  Valid values for
.I type
are
.BR 0 ,
.BR none ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_none ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR cache ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_cache ,
.BR 2 ,
.BR nsdb ", or"
.BR fedfs_resolve_nsdb .
The value is not case-sensitive.

The pathname contains a character which is not
supported by the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_BADNAME

supported by the remote server,
but the name is not supported by the remote server
as a valid name for the current operation.
.TP

.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_LOOP

A hard error occurred on the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NOTJUNCT
The pathname does not end in a junction.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NOTLOCAL
The pathname contains a junction in any position other than the last component.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_PERM
The operation was not allowed because the caller is
either not a privileged user or not the owner of an object that
would be modified by the operation.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_SVRFAULT
An unanticipated non-protocol error occurred on the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_ROUTE
The remote server was unable to find a route to the NSDB.
.TP

The remote server was unable to authenticate
and establish a secure connection with the NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP
An LDAP error occurred on the connection between the remote server and NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_VAL
Indicates the same error as FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP,
and allows an LDAP protocol error value to be returned to the client.

.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_NOFSN
The remote server was unable to locate the given FSN in the appropriate NSDB.

local FSN-to-FSL cache if it exists.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NO_CACHE_UPDATE
The remote server was unable to update its FSN-to-FSL cache.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that your domain's NSDB hostname is
.IR nsdb.example.net .
You have created a FedFS junction on remote server
.IR fs.example.net .
To see how the junction appears on the remote server, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-junction -h fs.example.net -p /export/junction1 -t none
.br
Call completed successfully
.br
FSN UUID: 89c6d208-7280-11e0-9f1d-000c297fd679
.br
NSDB: nsdb.example.net:389
.sp
.RE
To see real-time junction resolution results as the remote server sees them, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-junction -h fs.example.net -p /export/junction1 -t nsdb
.br
Server returned FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_NOFSN
.sp
.RE
In this example, the junction exists on the remote server,
but the domain's NSDB has not yet been updated to contain a list of
fileset locations for the FSN contained in the junction.
The remote server is therefore not able to resolve the junction.
.SH SECURITY
RPCSEC GSSAPI authentication has not yet been implemented for this command.
