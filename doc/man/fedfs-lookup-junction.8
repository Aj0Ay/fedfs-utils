.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers allow remote administrative access via an
authenticated RPC protocol known as the
.IR "FedFS ADMIN protocol" .
Using this protocol, FedFS administrators manage
FedFS junctions and NSDB connection parameter information
on remote FedFS-enabled file servers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fedfs-lookup-junction (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs
that is intended for testing the FedFS ADMIN protocol or for use in scripts.
It sends a single FEDFS_LOOKUP_JUNCTION request to a remote
FedFS ADMIN protocol service.
.P
The FEDFS_LOOKUP_JUNCTION request causes a remote server
to reveal the contents of a junction,
or to report cached or immediate NSDB lookup results as that server sees them.
The contents of a FedFS junction are an FSN UUID and an NSDB name and port.
.P
The
.BR fedfs-lookup-junction (8)
command takes a single positional parameter which is the
pathname on the remote server of the junction to be looked up.
The pathname is relative to the root
of the local file system on the remote server.
.P
Resolving a junction means performing an NSDB query with the contents
of the junction to obtain a list of fileset locations, or FSLs,
matching the stored FSN UUID.
The meaning of these is described in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
There are three distinct types of junction lookup:
.TP
.B none
The remote server reports the actual contents of the junction stored
on its local disk.
This includes an FSN UUID and the name and port of an NSDB.
If the
.B \-t
option is not specified, this type of lookup is performed.
.TP
.B cache
The remote server reports lookup results it may have cached from
previous junction lookup requests.
This includes an FSN UUID, the name and port of an NSDB, and the cached
list of fileset locations matching the FSN UUID in the junction.
Not all FedFS ADMIN service implementations support this type of request.
.TP
.B nsdb
The remote server performs a fresh junction lookup
and the results are returned.
This includes an FSN UUID, the name and port of an NSDB,
and a list of fileset locations matching the FSN UUID in the junction.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables debugging messages during operation.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Displays
.BR fedfs-lookup-junction (8)
version information and a usage message on
.IR stderr .
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-hostname=\fIhostname\fP"
Specifies the hostname of a remote FedFS ADMIN service.
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR localhost .
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-nettype=\fInettype\fP"
Specifies the transport to use when contacting the remote FedFS ADMIN service.
Typically the
.I nettype
is one of
.B tcp
or
.BR udp .
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR netpath .
See
.BR rpc (3t)
for details.
.IP "\fB\-p, \-\-path=\fIpathname\fP"
Specifies the location on the remote server where the target FedFS junction
resides.
This pathname is relative to the remote server's physical root directory,
not the remote server's NFS pseudoroot.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-resolvetype=\fItype\fP"
Specifies the desired type of resolution.  Valid values for
.I type
are
.BR 0 ,
.BR none ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_none ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR cache ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_cache ,
.BR 2 ,
.BR nsdb ", or"
.BR fedfs_resolve_nsdb .
The value is not case-sensitive.
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR none .

.B FEDFS_ERR_BADCHAR
The pathname contains a character which is not
supported by the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_BADNAME

as a valid name for the current operation.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NAMETOOLONG
The length of the pathname exceeds the remote serverâ€™s implementation limit.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_LOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving the pathname.
.TP

processing the request.

One of the arguments was not valid.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_IO
A hard error occurred on the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NOTJUNCT
The pathname does not end in a junction.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NOTLOCAL
The pathname contains a junction in any position other than the last component.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_PERM
The operation was not allowed because the caller is
either not a privileged user or not the owner of an object that
would be modified by the operation.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_SVRFAULT
An unanticipated non-protocol error occurred on the remote server.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_ROUTE
The remote server was unable to find a route to the NSDB.

An LDAP error occurred on the connection between the remote server and NSDB.
.TP
.B FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP_VAL
Indicates the same error as FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_LDAP,

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that your domain's NSDB hostname is
.IR nsdb.example.net .
You have created a FedFS junction on remote server
.IR fs.example.net .
To see how the junction appears on the file server, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-junction -h fs.example.net /export/junction1
.br
Call completed successfully
.br
FSN UUID: 89c6d208-7280-11e0-9f1d-000c297fd679
.br
NSDB: nsdb.example.net:389
.sp
.RE
To see real-time junction lookup results as the remote server sees them, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-junction -h fs.example.net -t nsdb /export/junction1
.br
Server returned FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_NOFSN
.sp
.RE
In this example, the junction exists on the file server,
but the domain's NSDB has not yet been updated to contain a list of
fileset locations for the FSN UUID contained in the junction.
The file server is therefore not able to resolve the junction.
.SH SECURITY
RPCSEC GSSAPI authentication has not yet been implemented for this command.
