.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The bulk of FedFS junction information in a FedFS domain is stored
on one or more LDAP servers.
These servers are known as
.IR "namespace databases" ,
or NSDBs, for short.
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers and clients access the information stored
on NSDBs via standard LDAP queries.
FedFS-enabled file servers use these queries to resolve FedFS junctions.
FedFS administrators use them to manage information
about file sets contained in a FedFS domain name space.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs that are
intended for testing the NSDB protocol or for use in scripts.
This command deletes a FedFS
.I fileset location
(FSL) record from an NSDB.
.P
A fileset location, or FSL, uniquely identifies the location of one
replica of a fileset.
An FSL consists of two UUIDs, the hostname and port of an NSDB,
and the hostname and port of the file server where the replica resides.
The meaning of these items is described in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
FSLs are stored in records on an NSDB.
These records are stored as children of FSN records.
Replicas of these records can exist on more than one LDAP server.
.P
The
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command removes an FSL record from the named NSDB.
It does not remove parent FSN records;
to remove FSN records, use
.BR nsdb-delete-fsn (8).
It does not remove a replica of a fileset;
to remove fileset replicas,
use appropriate file server administrative commands.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Specifies that debugging messages be produced during operation.
.IP "\fB\-x, \-\-fsluuid=\fIuuid\fP"
Specifies the FSL UUID of the doomed FSL record.
If the
.B -x
option is not specified, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-fsnuuid=\fIuuid\fP"
Specifies the FSN UUID of the doomed FSL record's parent FSN record.
If the
.B -u
option is not specified,
or an FSN record for this FSN UUID does not already exist
on the specified NSDB, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Prints an
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
version and usage message on
.IR stderr ,
then exits.
.IP "\fB-D, \-\-binddn=\fIbind-distinguished-name\fP"
Specifies a distinguished name of an entity used to bind to this LDAP server.
If the
.B -D
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_ADMIN environment variable is consulted.
If this variable is not set,
the NSDB connection parameter database is searched for this DN.
If none of these is specified, or
if this entity does not have permission to modify this area
of the server's DIT, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB-e, \-\-nce=\fINSDB-container-entry-distinguished-name\fP"
Specifies the distinguished name of the NSDB container entry
under which this FSL is to be created.
If the
.B -e
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_NCE environment variable is consulted.
If this variable is not set,
then the NSDB connection parameter database is searched for this DN.
If none of these is specified, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-nsdbname=\fINSDB-hostname\fP"
Specifies the hostname of the NSDB where the new FSL record should reside.
If the
.B -l
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_HOST environment variable is consulted.
If the variable is not set and the
.B -l
option is not specified, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-nsdbport=\fINSDB-port\fP"
Specifies the IP port of the NSDB where the new FSL record should reside.
If the
.B -r
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_PORT environment variable is consulted.
The default value if the variable is not set is 389.
.IP "\fB\-w, \-\-passwd=\fIbinddn-password\fP"
Specifies the password used for simple authentication to this LDAP server.
If the
.B -w
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_PASSWD environment variable is consulted.
If the variable is not set and the
.B -w
option is not specified, the
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command asks for a password on
.IR stdin .
Standard password blanking techniques are used
to obscure the password on the user's terminal.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that you have an FSN that looks like:
.RS
.sp
	FSN UUID: 8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679
.br
	NSDB: ldap.example.net:389
.sp
.RE
Further suppose the NSDB
.I ldap.example.net:389
has an NSDB container entry whose distinguished name is
.IR o=fedfs .
The replica of this fileset that exists at
.I fileserver.example.net:/path
has just been removed, and it's FSL UUID is
.IR 323c5068-7c11-11e0-8d38-000c297fd679 .
To delete the corresponding FSL record, you might use:
.RS
.sp
$ nsdb-delete-fsl -D cn=Manager -e o=fedfs \\
.br
	-u 8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679
.br
	-x 323c5068-7c11-11e0-8d38-000c297fd679
.br
	-l ldap.example.net
.br
Enter NSDB password:
.br
Successfully deleted FSL record
  fedfsFslUuid=323c5068-7c11-11e0-8d38-000c297fd679,
  fedfsFsnUuid=8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679,o=fedfs
.sp
.RE
The FSL record for the specified replica is removed,
leaving possibly other FSL records for this fileset,
and leaving the parent FSN record intact.
.SH SECURITY
Modify access to the LDAP's DIT is required to delete an FSL record.
The
.BR nsdb-delete-fsl (8)
command must bind as an entity permitted to modify the DIT
to perform this operation.
.P
The target LDAP server must be registered in the local NSDB connection
parameter database.
The connection security mode listed
in the NSDB connection parameter database
for the target LDAP server is used during this operation.
See
.BR nsdbparams (8)
for details on how to register an NSDB
in the local NSDB connection parameter database.
