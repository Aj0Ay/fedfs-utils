.SH NAME
fedfs \- The Linux Federated File System implementation
.SH DESCRIPTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
.P
A file system referral is like a symbolic link
to another file system share,
but it is not visible to applications.
It behaves like an automounted directory where a new file system 
mount is done when an application first accesses that directory.
The arguments of such automatic mount operations are controlled
by information returned by the file server.
A file server can even return a list of several servers
for a client to try to mount.
.P
Today, file system referral mechanisms exist
in several network file system protocols.
FedFS provides its namespace features using referral mechanisms
already built in to network file system protocols
so that no change to file system protocols or clients is required.
.P
Currently, the Linux FedFS implementation supports only
NFS version 4 referrals.
More on NFS version 4 referrals can be found in RFC 3530.
FedFS may support other network file system protocols in the future.
.SH FEDFS DOMAIN OPERATION
A file system referral that is managed by FedFS is called a
.IR "FedFS junction" .
Junctions join multiple file server shares into a single coherent
FedFS namespace.
On FedFS-enabled Linux file servers, the
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
daemon creates and removes FedFS junctions.
.P
An independently administered FedFS namespace is referred to as a
.IR "FedFS domain" .
The top-level directory of a FedFS domain is referred to as its
.IR "domain root" .
.P
Domain roots typically contain nothing but FedFS junctions
and other directories.
Useful data is contained in other shares
which clients discover by following FedFS junctions
in the domain root directory.
.P
Although FedFS junctions are stored on file servers,
they are lightweight objects that contain little actual data.
The bulk of FedFS junction information in a FedFS domain
is stored on an LDAP server.
LDAP servers that store FedFS information are known as
.IR "namespace databases" ,
or NSDBs, for short.
.P
Any standard LDAP server can become an NSDB if it knows the FedFS schema
(the definitions of FedFS record types).
The Linux FedFS implementation is designed to work with NSDBs residing
on any standard LDAP server that use the standard FedFS schema
laid out in the FedFS NSDB draft.
.P
FedFS groups a set of directories in a file system namespace
into a single administrative unit called a
.IR fileset .
For NFS, a whole share might be considered a fileset.
.P
To function as a FedFS fileset,
a set of directories must have a name unique in a FedFS domain,
and a set of locations where the file data is stored.
A FedFS
.I fileset name
is a UUID and an NSDB domainname and port.
A FedFS
.I fileset location
is an LDAP record that describes the location
(the server where it resides, and its export path)
of a copy of a fileset's data.
.P
A fileset, for example, can have multiple replicas.
Such a fileset has one FedFS fileset name,
and each replica of the fileset has an individual FedFS fileset location record.
.P
A FedFS junction, then, contains nothing more than a FedFS fileset name.
When a file server resolves a FedFS junction, it performs an LDAP
query against the NSDB named in the junction using the UUID named in the junction.
The NSDB returns location information stored in FedFS fileset location records
for that FedFS fileset name.
The file server returns this location information to its clients
via a file system referral.
.P
On Linux NFS file servers,
.BR rpc.mountd (8)
is the gateway through which the in-kernel NFS server performs
FedFS junction resolution.
.SS Discovering domain roots
As with other FedFS filesets,
copies of a domain root can exist on multiple file servers.
These copies are known as
.IR "domain root replicas" .
Two types of domain root replicas are available in a FedFS domain:
read-only and read-write.
.P
Clients by default use read-only replicas,
which are mounted in a standard place on all clients.
Files residing in a FedFS domain appear at the same location in the
domain's namespace on all clients.
Replicas of a domain's root are located by looking for
DNS SRV records that advertise file servers exporting domain root replicas.
.P
By convention, the top of the global FedFS namespace looks like this:
.RS
.sp
.RI / fstype / domainname
.sp
.RE
where
.I fstype
specifies a network file system protocol to use, and
.I domainname
specifies a FedFS domain.
Currently, the Linux FedFS implementation recognizes only
.B nfs4
as a valid fstype.
.P
If
.I domainname
begins with a dot (period),
the pathname refers to a read-write replica of the domain's root.
Otherwise, it refers to a read-only replica.
Note this means that the read-write replicas, and all parts of the
file system below them,
are visible at a different point in a client's name space
than are read-only replicas.
.SS Globally Useful Names
On FedFS-enabled Linux clients, the
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
command finds and mounts the root of a FedFS domain.
.P
Typically, FedFS clients mount the FedFS namespace so that FedFS
pathnames appear the same on all clients.
Such pathnames are referred to as
.IR "globally useful names" ,
since a globally useful name refers to exactly the same file object
on every client in a domain.
For example, the FedFS globally useful name
.I /nfs4/example.net
would be mounted on a local directory on the client called
.I /nfs4/example.net
so that applications have the same view of the
.I example.net
domain namespace on all FedFS clients.
.P
Note that the Linux
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
command can attach anywhere in the client's local file namespace
any directory in the FedFS namespace the client
has permission to access.
This can be useful to ensure local namespace compatibility in some cases,
or hide parts of the FedFS namespace for security purposes.
However, it breaks cross-platform application interoperability
by presenting applications with multiple pathnames to the same file object.
Therefore it should be avoided.
.SS Mount option inheritance
When encountering a file system referral, the Linux client
treats it as a server-initiated mount request.
The referring server provides only a list of server names and export paths.
The mount options for this new mount are inherited from the new mount
pointâ€™s parent directory on the client.
.P
As applications proceed deeper into a domain's namespace,
they encounter both file sets to which they have
read-only access, and file sets to which they have read-write
access.
To allow the server to provide proper access to both types of file sets,
typically both domain root replica types are mounted read-write
on FedFS clients. 
All submounts of the domain root are then mounted read-write as well.
.P
For example, a domain root may contain an NFS version 4 referral to an
export containing user home directories.
The domain root is read-only,
but user home directories would not be very useful if they could not be
written to.
The file server continues to employ user credentials to limit access
as appropriate.
.P
File system clients follow file system referrals
as applications encounter them,
which is similar to how an automounter works.
Consider the initial mount of the domain root
as if you are mounting a single whole file system,
even though underneath, additional NFS mounts come and go as needed.
.SH SECURITY
Each host in a FedFS domain plays one or more of the following roles,
each of which have different security requirements.
.IP "\fINSDB server\fP"
LDAP server that contains FedFS domain information
.IP "\fIFedFS file server\fP"
stores data accessible via a FedFS domain name space
.IP "\fIFedFS client\fP"
accesses data in FedFS domain name spaces
.IP "\fIFedFS admin client\fP"
manages FedFS domain information
.P
The Linux FedFS implementation provides administrative tools
to manage FedFS fileset name and location records in an NSDB.
Junction resolution uses anonymous LDAP search requests, and
administration takes place via authenticated LDAP modification requests.
.P
File servers and administrative clients use clear-text or TLS encrypted
transports to perform junction lookups and administrative requests.
The Linux FedFS implementation provides tools for managing X.509
certificates required for LDAP over TLS.
Junction lookups are performed anonymously, but administrative
requests require LDAP authentication.
.P
FedFS junction objects are created on file servers
by a side-band RPC protocol called the
.IR "FedFS admin protocol" .
This protocol is separate from network file system protocols to allow
FedFS to work without any modification to network file system protocols.
The protocol uses RPCSEC GSS to authenticate or encrypt administrative requests.
.P
Since two separate protocols are involved
when administering junctions and filesets,
junctions are created on file servers and
registered with the domain's NSDB in two separate steps.
