.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The bulk of FedFS junction information in a FedFS domain is stored
on one or more LDAP servers.
These servers are known as
.IR "namespace databases" ,
or NSDBs, for short.
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers and clients access the information stored
on NSDBs via standard LDAP queries.
FedFS-enabled file servers use these queries to resolve FedFS junctions.
FedFS administrators use them to manage information
about file sets contained in a FedFS domain name space.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs that are
intended for testing the NSDB protocol or for use in scripts.
This command resolves a FedFS
.I fileset name
(FSN) record on an NSDB into a list of fileset locations.
.P
A fileset name, or FSN, uniquely identifies a fileset in FedFS.
An FSN consists of a UUID and the hostname and port of an NSDB.
This pair is intended to be unique across all of FedFS.
The meaning of these items is described in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
A FedFS junction contains an FSN.
There can be multiple junctions that contain a particular FSN.
There is exactly one FSN record stored on an NSDB that corresponds to this FSN.
The FSN record can have zero or more FSL records as children.
Replicas of these records can exist on more than one LDAP server.
.P
The
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command looks up an FSN record on the named NSDB
and returns the set of FSL records that are its children.
This is the same operation that FedFS-enabled file servers perform
when resolving the FSN contained in a FedFS junction.
.P
This command has one positional parameter which specifies
the UUID of the FSN record to resolve.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables debugging messages during operation.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Displays
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
version information and a usage message on
.IR stderr .
.IP "\fB-e, \-\-nce=\fINSDB-container-entry-distinguished-name\fP"
Specifies the distinguished name of the NSDB Container Entry
under which this FSN record resides.
If the
.B \-\-nce
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_NCE environment variable is consulted.
If this variable is not set,
then the NSDB connection parameter database is searched for this DN.
If none of these is specified, the
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command searches the NSDB's naming contexts to discover its NCEs.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-nsdbname=\fINSDB-host-name\fP"
Specifies the NSDB hostname portion of the FSN to resolve.
If the
.B \-\-nsdbname
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_HOST environment variable is consulted.
If the variable is not set and the
.B \-\-nsdbname
option is not specified, the
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command fails.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-nsdbport=\fINSDB-port\fP"
Specifies the NSDB IP port portion of the FSN to resolve.
If the
.B \-\-nsdbport
option is not specified,
the value of the FEDFS_NSDB_PORT environment variable is consulted.
The default value if the variable is not set is 389.

command received an LDAP referral that it chose not to follow,
either because the local implementation does not support
following LDAP referrals or LDAP referral following is disabled.
.TP

The
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command received an LDAP referral that it chose not to follow
because the local NSDB connection parameter database had no

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that you have created a new FSN that looks like:
.RS
.sp
	FSN UUID: 8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679
.br
	NSDB: nsdb.example.net:389
.sp
.RE
Further suppose the NSDB
.I nsdb.example.net:389
has an NSDB Container Entry whose distinguished name is
.IR o=fedfs ,
and that the FSN has a single FSL child record.
To resolve the FSN, you might use:
.RS
.sp
$ nsdb-resolve-fsn -e o=fedfs \\
.br
	-l nsdb.example.net \\
.br
	8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679
.sp
For FSN UUID 8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679
.br
    FSN TTL  600
.sp
------------------------------------------------------
.br

.br
    fedfsFsnUuid=8e246ddc-7b46-11e0-8252-000c297fd679,o=fedfs
.sp

.br
 NFS fls_currency:		-1
.sp
.RE
and so on.
.SH SECURITY
The NSDB protocol draft standard requires that FedFS FSN and FSL
records are readable by everyone.
The
.BR nsdb-resolve-fsn (8)
command uses anonymous binding to perform LDAP queries.
.P
The target LDAP server must be registered in the local NSDB connection
parameter database.
The connection security mode listed
in the NSDB connection parameter database
for the target LDAP server is used during this operation.
See
.BR nsdbparams (8)
for details on how to register an NSDB
in the local NSDB connection parameter database.
