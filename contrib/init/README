Items in the contrib/init subdirectory are provided on an as-is basis as a
courtesy.  These items are not tested as part of the fedfs-utils check-in
or release process.  They are not installed by the fedfs-utils Makefiles,
but must be installed as needed by hand.

Use them at your own risk, but do report bugs to us and we will try to
see that issues are addressed in the fedfs-utils distribution.
